## Install

Using composer:
```bash
composer require davidgorges/color-contrast
```

## Usage
````php
    use ColorContrast\ColorContrast;

    /* ... */
    
    $contrast = new ColorContrast();
    $contrast->addColors(0xff0000, 0x002200, 0x0022ff, 0xffffff);
    $combinations = $contrast->getCombinations(ColorContrast::MIN_CONTRAST_AAA);
    foreach ($combinations as $combination) {
        printf("#%s on the Background color #%s has a contrast value of %f \n", $combination->getForeground(), $combination->getBackground(), $combination->getContrast());
    }
````

this would output:
````
    #FFFFFF on the Background color #002200 has a contrast value of 17.949476
    #FFFFFF on the Background color #0022FF has a contrast value of 8.033817
    #002200 on the Background color #FFFFFF has a contrast value of 17.949476
    #0022FF on the Background color #FFFFFF has a contrast value of 8.033817
````

### Dark or Light Complimentary Color

````php
    $contrast = new ColorContrast();
    
    // imagine having a red background and you need to know if its better
    // to display a white or black text on top if it
    $complimentary = $contrast->complimentaryTheme('#d80000'); // returns ColorContrast::DARK to indicate you should use a dark color on this background
    
    if($complimentary == ColorContrast::LIGHT) {
        // Use a light font
    } else {
        // use a dark font
    }
````
